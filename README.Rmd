```

### Overview

This [Shiny app](http://yhat.io/shiny/atl-salary-data/) explores the Atlanta city employee salaries data for the Year 2015. In particular, the relationship between employee ``salary`` and variables such as ``gender``, ``age``, and ``ethnic group``.

Dataset obtained from [data.world](https://data.world/brentbrewington/atlanta-city-employee-salaries), contributed by [Brent Brewington](https://github.com/bbrewington/atlanta-salary-data).

The Shiny app consists of,

- A **_Selector Panel_** which allows user to select points using cursor (click-and-drag)
- **_Plot 1_** displays the relationship of employee ``median salary`` by ``age group``, seperated by ``gender``
- **_Plot 2_** displays the relationship of employee ``median salary`` by ``ethnic group``, seperated by ``gender``
- A **_Cross Table_** which tabulates count at each combination of ``ethnic group`` and ``gender``

### Motivation

This Shiny app is meant as a simple exercise to demonstrate how unbalanced dataset can be misleading at times. 

If we look at male and female ``median salary`` at various ``age group``, we might observe that *in general, male earns higher pay than female*.

```{r, warning=FALSE}
library(dplyr)

raw <- readRDS("Data/atl_2015.RDS") %>% 
    rename(ethnic = ethnic.origin, job = job.title, salary = annual.salary) %>% 
    mutate(gender = factor(sex), ethnic = factor(ethnic)) %>% 
    as_tibble()

x_agegrp <- raw %>% group_by(age) %>% summarise(n = n()) %>% filter(n < 10) %>% pull(age) 

# Ethnic group that has a sample size smaller than 30
x_ethgrp <- raw %>% group_by(ethnic) %>% summarise(n = n()) %>% filter(n < 30) %>% droplevels() %>% pull(ethnic) 

dat <- raw %>% 
    # Filter small sample size group for both 'age' and 'ethnic'
    filter(!age %in% x_agegrp &!ethnic %in% x_ethgrp) %>% 
    # and simplify ethnic group to first word only
    mutate(ethnic = factor(stringr::str_extract(ethnic, "^[A-Z]?[a-z]+")))
```

```{r}
dat %>%
    group_by(age, sex) %>% 
    summarise(salary = median(salary)) %>% 
    ggplot(aes(age, salary, col = sex, group = sex)) + 
    scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(20, 100, 10), limits = c(20, 70)) +
    geom_line() + 
    labs(x = "Age", y = "Median Salary", col = "Sex") +
    theme(legend.position = "bottom")
```

However, if we look at male and female ``median salary`` by ``ethnic groups``, we notice that female's median salary does not seem to be lagging behind. *For Asian and White women, their median salary is actually higher than men by an obvious margin*.

```{r}
dat %>% 
    group_by(ethnic, sex) %>% 
    summarise(salary = median(salary)) %>% 
    ggplot(aes(ethnic, salary, col = sex)) +
    geom_line(col = "gray") +
    geom_point() +
    labs(x = "Ethnic Group", y = "Median Salary", col = "Sex") +
    theme(legend.position = "bottom")
```

Tinker around the Shiny app to find out why is that so.
